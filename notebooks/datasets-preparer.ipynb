    "This notebook is designed to prepare datasets for predicting Bitcoin price and movement. It is divided into three key parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Part 1: Preparing a dataset from our [scraped news articles](https://github.com/Bitcoin-Price-Prediction-Experiments/Bitcoin-News-Scraper). The goal is to merge those two datasets into a single one, and add a sentiment column, reflecting the sentiment of each article.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Part 2: Preparing a similar dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/oliviervha/crypto-news), which already contains sentiment data. However, since the sentiment scores are inaccurate, we will clean up unnecessary columns and apply a more precise sentiment analysis model.\n",
    "Note: This dataset will be merged with the one from Part 1.\n",
    "- Part 3: Preparing a dataset from the files we [downloaded](https://github.com/Bitcoin-Price-Prediction-Experiments/Bitcoin-Transaction-History-Downloader) from Bitget. The data will be organized into 5-hour intervals to align with market movement analysis."
