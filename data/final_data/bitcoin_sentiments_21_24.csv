2024-09-12,"According to Cointelegraph, the TIME Magazine reporter who conducted one of the first foreign correspondent interviews with El Salvador President Nayib Bukele in three years has suggested that his push for Bitcoin as legal tender was more about image than substance. In an interview with Crooked Media’s Pod Save the World released on Sept. 11, Vera Bergengruen reported that Bukele’s advisers referred to Bitcoin (BTC) adoption in El Salvador as a “great rebranding” and “complete PR [public relations] move.” Bukele briefly led his family’s PR firm before moving into politics, becoming the Mayor of Nuevo Cuscatlán, Mayor of San Salvador, and president of El Salvador. “I think the most important thing [...] is his past as a publicist,” said Bergengruen, referring to Bukele. “It’s important to understand from Bitcoin to the war on the gangs, everything he does he’s kind of image first, results later oriented.” She added that Bitcoin was never really meant to be adopted to significantly change Salvadorans’ economic situation. Many in the crypto industry began paying attention to El Salvador and Bukele starting in 2021 after the president announced plans to recognize BTC as a legal tender. According to Bergengruen, the announcement was the first for the industry and the public in El Salvador, resulting in Bukele’s team having to “backtrack” and promote potential benefits of Bitcoin, like foreign remittances. “It was chaos from the start, but they needed to kind of at least pretend that it was really going to help El Salvador,” said Bergengruen. “It was very obvious that it was kind of for tourists, for foreigners, for [Bukele] to have something to talk about that changes the narrative. If that was the goal, they have been successful.” Bukele initially pushed for creating a volcano-powered “Bitcoin City” in the country, but the program was not completed more than three years later. He regularly posts on social media about using El Salvador’s funds to purchase BTC. According to Bergengruen’s interview, the president reported having roughly $400 million in the country’s “public wallet alone.” Bukele will serve as El Salvador’s president in his current term until 2029.",Time Magazine reporter Vera Bergengruen believes El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele's push for Bitcoin as legal tender was more about image than substance.

2024-09-12,"According to BlockBeats, on September 12, CryptoQuant analyst Tarek On-Chain shared insights on social media regarding the current trends in Bitcoin reserves on exchanges. He noted that Bitcoin reserves on exchanges are significantly decreasing, a trend that typically signals a price increase. The reduction in Bitcoin reserves on exchanges implies a decrease in selling pressure as investors move their Bitcoin to cold wallets, reducing the available supply in the market. Historically, such transfers have often been accompanied by price peaks, suggesting a similar situation might be unfolding now.At the same time, the reserves of stablecoins on exchanges are increasing, indicating that investors are preparing to enter the market. Stablecoins represent capital that can be deployed at any moment, and their increasing reserves suggest that traders are waiting for the right opportunity to enter the market. This growth indicates a strong buying intention within the market.Decreasing Bitcoin reserves and increasing stablecoin reserves sets the stage for a potential price surge. With the supply of Bitcoin decreasing and purchasing power increasing, the market is poised for an upward trend. Historically, such supply-demand imbalances have often led to significant price increases.The decrease in Bitcoin reserves coupled with the increase in stablecoin reserves suggests a bullish outlook for Bitcoin. As market supply tightens and purchasing power accumulates, we may see a price breakout in the coming weeks. Investors should remain vigilant and watch for potential market upswings.",The current trends in Bitcoin reserves on exchanges are decreasing and stablecoin reserves are increasing.

However, he mentioned that the past four weeks might have started to show signs of a reversal, although this has not yet been confirmed. Woo emphasized that more time is needed for Bitcoin to break its historical highs.On a macro level, Woo pointed out that risk signals have validated lower lows, indicating that Bitcoin is not in a bear market.

2024-09-12,"According to CoinDesk, Bitcoin rose above $58,000 during Asian trading hours on Thursday, driven by a rally in U.S. technology stocks and gains in Asian equity markets. Despite this increase, U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs experienced outflows, with Ark Invest’s ARKB seeing a notable $54 million outflow, contributing to a total loss of $43 million after a two-day inflow streak.U.S. inflation data for August supported expectations for a Federal Reserve rate cut in the coming weeks, as core inflation rose faster than anticipated to more than 0.3%. This economic backdrop saw chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) end the day up 8.2%, while major stocks like Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOGL), and Apple (AAPL) saw gains as high as 2.13%. These gains extended to Asian markets on Thursday, with stock indices in Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan surging. Japan’s Nikkei 225 index broke out of a seven-day losing streak as the yen slightly retreated after hitting a record high against the U.S. dollar on Tuesday.Meanwhile, layer-1 blockchain Sui (SUI) outperformed the market, rising over 16% according to CoinDesk Indices data, compared to a 1.67% rise in the broader CoinDesk 20 (CD20) index. SUI's performance is likely influenced by Grayscale’s recent announcement about opening the Grayscale Sui Trust. According to Grayscale, the NAV per share of the Trust is $13.50, with each share containing 14.95 SUI tokens, valuing each Sui token in the trust at 90 cents. Given Sui’s current market value of just over $1, the market appears to be anticipating a Grayscale discount.Elsewhere, AI tokens posted modest gains amid reports that OpenAI is planning to raise $6.5 billion at a valuation of $150 billion. NEAR Protocol’s NEAR token increased by 6%, while the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance’s FET token rose by 9%, trading above $1.40.","Bitcoin rose above $58,000 during Asian trading hours on Thursday, driven by a rally in technology stocks and gains in Asian equity markets.

2024-09-12,"This week, our desk noticed that BTC market volatility started to pick up, with multiple key data releases on the US labour market and CPI before next week’s FOMC meeting. BTC price was closely tracking the US equities performance, while some altcoins had a more independent journey.Sui ($SUI) is a unique Layer 1 blockchain and smart contract platform that seeks to enhance digital asset ownership by making it fast, private, and accessible to everyone. The recently launched Grayscale Sui Trust, by the digital asset manager Grayscale, is available to accredited investors for SUI exposure. The bullish news helped SUI achieve a 15.3% gain in one week while BTC had a 0.8% loss during the same time.Book of Meme ($BOME) also saw strong trade demand on Convert last week. This meme coin saw a 73.4% volume increase on Convert and a 4.1% gain last week, outperforming many other meme coins with similar market capitalization.The layer-1 blockchain Cardano ($ADA) was introduced in 2017 by Charles Hoskinson, a co-founder of Ethereum. Its eagerly awaited ""Chang"" update was released on September 1st, completing the ecosystem's long-term shift to decentralized governance. Holders of ADA tokens will be able to influence Cardano's future by choosing governance representatives and approving development ideas thanks to this hard fork update. Last week, ADA had a 7.2% gain due to the bullish sentiment after the upgrade.Overall MarketThe above chart shows the BTC price movement in the 8-hour chart.The BTC price has been trading in this blue downward trend for nearly six months, and it has experienced a significant correction, with a 34% drop from the all-time high of $73,777 to $49,000, a market low caused by the carry trade unwind on August 5. As previously discussed, the $50k/$52k range served as a strong support zone, with the $57k level providing local support. BTC prices tested this again in the $50k/52k range last Friday following the disappointing nonfarm payroll data in the United States, raising market concerns about the US economy and the need for a 50 basis point rate cut by the Fed on September 18. Historically, when the Fed lowers interest rates in poor economic conditions, it usually results in a recession within 12 to 18 months.  And we expressed concern that the Fed's 50 basis point rate cut would trigger another round of risk asset sell-offs, pushing the BTC price below the strong support range of 50k/52k. If that scenario unfolds, the current bull cycle will effectively end and become the shortest in BTC history, aside from the 2013 cycle.This week's CPI data suggests that inflation in the United States is moving in the Fed's favour, and the market is now leaning toward a 25 basis point rate cut by the Fed on September 18. The reduced concern about a potential recession in the United States encourages risk-taking. Following the initial reaction to the CPI data, US stocks rallied and recovered all of their losses, closing higher. BTC tracked US equities closely, falling below $55.7k before rising above $57k before the session ended.The FOMC meeting will take place next week, and our desk anticipates some market volatility around the time when Fed Chair Powell delivers his speech after the meeting.Options MarketThe above chart is the 25-delta skewness on BTC options in the last two weeks.A 25-delta skew on options refers to the premium difference between a 25-delta call and a 25-delta put with the same expiry. The negative skew indicates that options traders would prefer to pay a higher premium on puts for downside protection than on calls for upside rewards. It provides a proxy measure for market sentiments by tracking the 25-delta skew across different expirations.As shown in the chart above, front-end BTC options (with a 7-day expiry) have been negative for the last two weeks, with the negative skew further lowering last Friday when BTC was sold below $52.7k. The chart also showed that market sentiment shifted to neutral over the weekend as the Bitcoin price recovered.The skew in medium- to long-term options suggested that options traders were not as bearish as indicated by the front-end options. In the last two weeks, the 60-day, 90-day, and 180-day expired options have all had above-zero skews, while the longer-dated options have maintained steady skews above 0. With the risk backdrop of reduced concern on the US recession and a Fed rate cut on the horizon, risk appetite is encouraged. We anticipate that the skew on BTC options across all durations will rise, indicating some bullish sentiment before/after the FOMC meeting.Macro at a glance Last Thursday (24-09-05)According to ADP nonfarm employment data, the US private market added only 99k new jobs in August, far below analysts' expectations of 144k. The weak ADP data raised market concerns about the US economy's conditions, increasing the likelihood of a 50 basis point rate cut by the Fed in September.Last week, the number of initial jobless claims in the United States was 227k, which was lower than the estimated 231k.The S&P Global Services PMI was 55.7 in August, up from the forecasted 55.2.Last Friday (24-09-06)In the United States, nonfarm payrolls (NFP) increased by 142,000 in August, less than 160,000 market expectations. This followed an increase of 89,000 in July, revised from 114,000. The USD index traded volatilely in the Friday session, while US equities fell as concerns about the US economy outweighed risk appetite.The US unemployment rate fell back to 4.2% in August, after hitting 4.3% in July.The unemployment rate in Canada increased to 6.6% in August, exceeding the forecasted 6.5% and July's 6.4%.BTC price experienced a significant sell-off in the Friday US session and found support at 52.5k following an 8% drop.On Monday (24-09-09)The unemployment rate in the UK fell to 4.1% in July from 4.2% in June, meeting economists' expectations.The German CPI fell by 0.1% monthly in August, compared to a 0.3% increase in July. The annualized CPI change was 1.9%, which is lower than the 2.3% increase in July.On Wednesday (24-09-11)The US CPI increased by 0.2% month on month in August, matching the pace seen in July. August saw annualized CPI growth of 2.5%, down from 2.9% in July. However, the monthly core CPI growth rate reaches 0.3%, exceeding the estimated 0.2% and July's 0.2%. The stubborn shelter cost served as the primary driver of the unexpectedly higher core CPI growth.The CPI data released on Wednesday solidified the Federal Reserve's decision to cut interest rates by 25 basis points next week, with an 86% probability. US equities initially lost some ground after the CPI data was released. The market then turned bullish as the Fed's chances of cutting interest rates by 25 basis points increased, and risk assets were bid up. The S&P 500 index finished up 1.07%, while the Nasdaq index rose 2.15%. As a first reaction, the BTC price fell below $55.7k before regaining the $57,000 level by market close.Convert Portal Volume ChangeThe above table shows the volume change on our Convert Portal by zone. Market volatility began to rise in early September, and the BTC price closely tracked US equities. Last Friday after the weak job data in the US, the BTC price fell below $52.7k amid rising concerns about the US economy. The sentiment improved over the weekend, and BTC returned to above $57k on Wednesday.Last week, the Megadrop Zone saw a volume increase of 59.8%. The primary reason for the volume increase was the high demand for BounceBit ($BB).The volume of the Storage zone increased by 14.0% during the same time period. The BitTorrent ($BTTC) demand surge was the primary driver of the volume increase in the Storage zone.In addition, the NFT Zone's volume increased by 4.3%.

2024-09-12,"According to CoinDesk, RootstockCollective has been introduced as the first decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) on Bitcoin layer-2 Rootstock. This new DAO will enable holders of the Rootstock token RIF to earn voting rights by staking their tokens. The launch signifies a continuation of concepts typically associated with Ethereum making their way to Bitcoin, the world's oldest blockchain. DAOs are blockchain-based organizations where decisions are made by token holders rather than a central authority. While DAOs are prevalent on networks like Ethereum and Solana, they have been largely absent from Bitcoin due to its programmability constraints. Rootstock, a layer-2 network, aims to enhance Bitcoin's utility and is compatible with Ethereum's EVM programming standard for smart contracts. This compatibility allows applications originally built on Ethereum or related chains to be easily transferred to Rootstock. The trend of building on Bitcoin gained traction in early 2023 with the Ordinals protocol, which introduced a Bitcoin version of non-fungible tokens (NFTs). This trend has continued with the introduction of memecoins and other fungible tokens on the Runes protocol, and the BitVM computing paradigm, which facilitates smart contracts on Bitcoin.

2024-09-11,"According to Odaily, Udi Wertheimer, an advocate of OP_CAT and co-founder of Taproot Wizards, recently expressed on social media that the user experience of BRC-20 and Runes has been disappointing for most cryptocurrency enthusiasts. He noted that Bitcoin consensus, including nodes and miners, does not recognize their existence. Wertheimer introduced a new Bitcoin-native token protocol called CATNIP, based on OP_CAT recursive contracts, which aims to address these issues. CATNIP allows for partial order fulfillment in the market, enabling users to purchase the exact amount of tokens they need without pre-splitting UTXOs. It also supports bidding, where users can specify the amount of CATNIP they wish to buy at a certain BTC price, allowing one or more sellers to complete the transaction. This protocol will even enable on-chain L1 AMM and liquidity pools. However, due to Bitcoin's slow block times and other issues related to transaction relay strategies, Wertheimer believes that L1 AMM will not provide a good experience. Nonetheless, CATNIP will also support fast and secure off-chain AMM, such as using CatVM. CATNIP is currently under development and testing.

2024-09-11,"According to BlockBeats, an analysis published by Coindesk on September 11 reveals that Bitcoin's weekly MACD has been negative since April, occasionally signaling the strongest bearish trend since 2022. However, Bitcoin's price has remained within a slightly downward-sloping channel between $50,000 and $70,000, forming a 'bull flag' pattern rather than a sharp decline, which contradicts the ongoing MACD signal. Global chart pattern expert Thomas N. Bulkowski typically defines a 'bull flag' pattern as a consolidation period characterized by a slightly downward-sloping channel following a steep upward trend. This pattern usually precedes a rise to higher levels, continuing the previous upward trend. Indicator data shows that since late April, the MACD has consistently been bearish. Combined with the flag price pattern, this suggests underlying bullish sentiment beneath the surface price action. This indicates that sellers have failed to establish a strong downward trend, even during the panic sell-off in early August, which only suppressed the price to between $55,000 and $50,000.

This event is notable as bitcoin mining is typically dominated by larger mining pools, such as FoundryUSA and Antpool, which together represent more than 50% of the total hash rate. Bitcoin blocks are produced approximately every 30 minutes, and the reward for successfully mining a block currently stands at 3.125 bitcoin, following a recent halving event earlier this year. Solo miners generally have limited computing power compared to large mining pools, although new solo mining rigs like BitAxe claim to offer 500 Giga Hashes per second (GH/s). Despite this, a solo miner winning a block is akin to winning a lottery, given the network's all-time high hashrate and difficulty, along with competition from institutional miners with immense computing power. Julio Moreno, head of research at CryptoQuant, explained that while it is not rare for a solo miner to find a block, it remains a low probability event. He noted that the production of small ASICs (mining equipment) has increased, allowing more individuals to mine from home. Despite the occasional success of solo miners, the mining pool space remains highly concentrated. FoundryUSA and Antpool alone account for 53% of the total Bitcoin network hashrate.

2024-09-09,"According to Bloomberg: US Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have experienced their longest run of daily net outflows since their launch earlier this year. Investors withdrew nearly $1.2 billion from the 12 Bitcoin ETFs over the eight days leading up to Sept. 6. This decline is part of a broader retreat from riskier assets as global markets face economic uncertainty.Factors Driving the OutflowsThe challenging market environment, fueled by mixed US jobs data and deflationary pressure in China, is having a significant impact on traders. As the short-term correlation between stocks and cryptocurrencies strengthens, Bitcoin's price movements have become more closely aligned with fluctuations in equity markets.Bitcoin has struggled in September, losing around 7%, although the digital asset saw a modest 1% increase to $54,870 by Monday afternoon in Singapore. Sean McNulty, director of trading at Arbelos Markets, noted that the recent uptick may be partially attributed to prominent influencers closing their short positions, citing BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes as an example.Political and Economic ImpactThe political climate is also influencing market sentiment. An improved showing by pro-crypto Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump in polls and prediction markets could be contributing to Bitcoin's small relief rally. McNulty reported increased demand for options hedges ahead of Tuesday’s debate between Trump and Democratic nominee Vice President Kamala Harris, who has yet to clarify her stance on cryptocurrencies.The original US Bitcoin ETFs debuted in January 2024 with strong demand, driving Bitcoin to a record high of $73,798 in March. However, inflows have since slowed, and Bitcoin’s year-to-date rally now stands at around 30%.Looking AheadCaroline Mauron, co-founder of Orbit Markets, a digital-asset derivatives liquidity provider, expects Bitcoin to remain in the $53,000 to $57,000 range until the US releases consumer price data on Wednesday. The upcoming inflation figures are likely to shape expectations for the Federal Reserve's anticipated monetary easing in the US.As the global economic outlook remains uncertain, Bitcoin and its associated ETFs continue to face significant volatility, with traders keeping a close eye on macroeconomic indicators and political developments.","US Bitcoin exchange-traded funds have experienced their longest run of daily net outflows since their launch earlier this year.

Bitcoin ATMs function similarly to traditional cash ATMs, requiring a PIN code and a withdrawal fee. However, the high value of cryptocurrencies makes these machines prime targets for hackers. Unlike cash ATMs, which might go unnoticed in a gas station, Bitcoin ATMs attract more attention from criminals.Timothy Bates, a cybersecurity professor at the University of Michigan's School of Innovation and Technology, stated that these machines are particularly vulnerable to both physical and cyber threats, making them a primary target for hackers and thieves.

2024-09-07,"According to 10x Research: Bitcoin is experiencing a significant downturn, but the signs were evident in the data, making this crash neither unexpected nor without cause. Here's a breakdown of what's driving Bitcoin's latest price correction and what to expect moving forward.Macroeconomic Data Signals CorrectionUnderstanding Market Events: The current Bitcoin crash emphasizes the importance of paying attention to macroeconomic data and its impact on crypto markets. Bitcoin is highly sensitive to shifts in the economy, and positioning around these events has become crucial for traders.Bitcoin’s Strategic Rebuy Zone: On-chain data suggests that Bitcoin's price correction is linked to new wallet activity and long-term holders exiting at high prices. A key signal for Bitcoin to become attractively priced again may be a drop into the $30,000 range.Breaking Support LevelsOn-Chain Data Trends: New Bitcoin addresses peaked in November 2023 and have sharply declined since. As short-term holders sold off their positions, long-term holders capitalized on high prices, signaling a market top. With increasing unrealized losses, Bitcoin is vulnerable to deeper corrections.Macroeconomic Indicators: The ISM Manufacturing Index, a leading economic indicator, confirms a cyclical peak for risk assets like Bitcoin. The Nasdaq and Bitcoin both reacted negatively to recent weak ISM prints, showing that economic indicators are driving Bitcoin’s repricing.Weakness Across SectorsBroader Economic Weakness: As the U.S. economy shows signs of weakness, DeFi and meme coin markets are also slowing down. The Ethereum network has seen a sharp revenue decline, supported by a downturn in DEX and meme coin trading. This broader slowdown is impacting both Ethereum and Solana, leading to further price corrections.Impact on Ether and Futures: Ether became highly vulnerable after the SEC hinted at ETH ETF approvals, leading futures traders to take long positions. When expectations weren’t met, Ether crashed in August, causing massive losses among traders and diminishing the appetite for risk.Bitcoin Spot ETF InfluenceETF Buyer Behavior: The hype surrounding Bitcoin Spot ETFs was a key factor driving high funding rates, which in turn fueled the self-reinforcing price cycle. Despite inflows of $17 billion into Bitcoin ETFs, these investors are now facing $2 billion in losses as Bitcoin’s price corrects. ETF outflows are signaling that many investors are exiting their positions.A Divergence from Gold: Bitcoin was marketed as ""digital gold,"" but unlike physical gold, which remains near all-time highs, Bitcoin has corrected like a typical risk asset. The demand for Bitcoin Spot ETFs has slowed, creating further downside pressure.The Future of BitcoinTopping Formation and Liquidations: Bitcoin’s topping pattern is playing out in a precise sequence. As new wallet growth slows and futures traders face liquidations, Bitcoin is increasingly behaving like a risk asset. This dynamic is likely to push Bitcoin prices down to $45,000 in the near term.In conclusion, Bitcoin's recent crash can be attributed to a combination of macroeconomic factors, weak market flows, and on-chain data trends.

2024-09-07,"According to Cointelegraph, El Salvador is celebrating the third anniversary of adopting Bitcoin as legal tender, a move that made it the first country in the world to do so on September 7, 2021. The initiative aimed to promote financial inclusion, streamline remittance payments, and attract financial innovation. President Nayib Bukele's decision to adopt Bitcoin has positioned El Salvador as a pioneer in the digital asset space. Alex Momot, founder and CEO of Peanut Trade crypto trading platform, remarked that while it is too early to declare the initiative a complete success, the country has certainly reaped some benefits. El Salvador has been dollar-cost-averaging into Bitcoin since 2021, purchasing one Bitcoin per day. As of now, the country's Bitcoin holdings have generated over $31 million in profit, according to the Nayib Bukele Portfolio Tracker website. The average buying price for El Salvador's Bitcoin was $43,877 per BTC, which is currently trading at $54,300. Momot highlighted that the financial gain strengthens Bukele's position, adding credibility to his bold cryptocurrency experiment. El Salvador currently holds a total of 5,865 Bitcoin, valued at over $318 million, according to the country's treasury website. Despite initial criticism, especially after Bitcoin's price fell from its all-time high of $69,000 in November 2021 to as low as $16,000 during the bear market, the country has managed to turn a profit. While El Salvador's adoption of Bitcoin has been closely watched, only one other country, the Central African Republic, has followed suit, adopting Bitcoin as legal tender in April 2022. Larger economies have remained hesitant, likely due to their dependence on relationships with international creditors who oppose such moves.

2024-09-06,"According to Cointelegraph, a new report from Bitcoin technology and financial services firm River forecasts that some companies in the United States will increase their exposure to Bitcoin (BTC) over the next 18 months. The report estimates that around 10% of US-based companies are likely to convert 1.5% of their treasury reserves, approximately $10.35 billion, to Bitcoin within this period.River's analysts highlighted that traditional corporate treasury strategies, which rely on cash and other short-term cash equivalents, are poor stores of value. These investments can generate modest returns near the federal funds rate, currently over 5%. However, even these short-term investments often fail to outperform inflation, diminishing the value of a treasury. The report noted that this inflationary erosion caused Apple, now a trillion-dollar corporation, to lose $15 billion of its treasury holdings over the last decade.The forecast points to the growing adoption of a corporate treasury strategy popularized by MicroStrategy founder Michael Saylor. In June 2024, MicroStrategy completed an additional $800 million debt sale of senior convertible notes at 2.25%, with a maturation date of 2032. The company used the funds from the corporate debt to purchase an additional 11,931 BTC. Saylor has characterized Bitcoin as an asset that guarantees “economic immortality” to corporations and businesses due to its capped supply and a lack of counterparty risk inherent in other stores of value, such as real estate or equities.MicroStrategy’s second-quarter earnings report revealed that it currently holds 226,500 BTC, valued at approximately $14.7 billion at the time. Saylor’s BTC treasury strategy has caused MicroStrategy to significantly outperform Warren Buffett’s investment company, Berkshire Hathaway. Since adopting the Bitcoin treasury strategy, MicroStrategy has risen by over 1,000%, while shares of Berkshire Hathaway rose by 104.75% during the same period. Buffett has declined to add Bitcoin to his portfolio or recommend it as a hedge against fiat inflation.","10% of US-based companies are likely to convert 1.5% of their treasury reserves to Bitcoin over the next 18 months.

2024-09-06,"According to Cointelegraph, Bitcoin's (BTC) price is experiencing bearish pressure as the total cryptocurrency market cap drops below $2 trillion. The crypto fear and greed index indicates 'extreme fear' in the market, a sentiment not seen since early August. Bitcoin recently hit a monthly low of $55,250 on September 6, testing an untouched demand zone from August. On the 1-hour chart, Bitcoin could potentially swing high toward $57,500, supported by a bullish divergence between the price and the relative strength index (RSI). Each swing low on the hourly chart has seen an average recovery of around 4% in September, which translates to a price range of $57,500 to $58,000. At $57,500, upside liquidation leverage positions are present, and day traders might view this as a short opportunity. A daily close below $55,000 could lead to further downside for BTC in the coming days, with a potential retest around $52,100. Axel Adler Jr., a Bitcoin researcher, notes that this is the 'next closest target' as it represents the current realized price of short-term holders. The range between $50,500 and $53,000 is marked by significant whale accumulations from February 2024. If Bitcoin fails to hold the $52,000 level, $49,000 is expected to be the final support price, putting its long-term bullish structure under serious bearish pressure. Similar to the last bull run in 2021, Bitcoin may retest the 50-weekly EMA if it drops to $49,000. Bitcoin has not closed a weekly candle below the 50-weekly EMA since October 2023. In 2021, the 50-weekly EMA provided support before the second leg of the rally, and the RSI reset around the 50 level. A similar reset is occurring now, and if the price action repeats, Bitcoin should avoid prolonged consolidation under $50,000 to prevent a weekly close below the key EMA level.

2024-09-05,"According to Cointelegraph, the total capital in Bitcoin-based decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols could surpass that of the Ethereum network within the next two years, as stated by Branden Sedo, an initial contributor at Bitcoin sidechain Core DAO. Speaking at Korea Blockchain Week, Sedo highlighted that the trillion dollars currently held in the Bitcoin ecosystem will gradually move on-chain, potentially overtaking Ethereum's network. He emphasized that Bitcoin's increasing value and the influx of institutional capital through exchange-traded products (ETPs) could drive this shift. Sedo noted that solutions like trustless bridges and roll-ups could facilitate the movement of capital on-chain, creating more opportunities for Bitcoin. The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year has spurred development activity and market enthusiasm for Bitcoin sidechains, including Core, Bitlayer, and Stacks. However, Sedo acknowledged that for Bitcoin’s DeFi total value locked (TVL) to surpass Ethereum’s, more Bitcoin holders need to become comfortable with using their Bitcoin in DeFi applications. The collapse of platforms like BlockFi and Celsius in 2022 has made many Bitcoiners wary of yield-bearing avenues, preferring to hold their Bitcoin in cold wallets. Despite this skepticism, Sedo has observed a shift in attitude among Bitcoiners, particularly towards non-custodial DeFi applications. After attending the Bitcoin 2024 conference in Nashville, Sedo noted a builder-centric vibe and excitement about the potential of the Bitcoin network. Sedo expressed confidence in Core’s non-custodial staking approach and its bridge powered by LayerZero, a major bridging protocol that has not experienced significant exploits. Core Chain allows users to time lock their Bitcoin, earning a 3% yield paid in CORE tokens, which are used for gas and governance on the network. Core recently surpassed Bitlayer to become the largest Bitcoin sidechain, with $314.4 million in TVL and 5,541 BTC staked on its network.

2024-09-05,"According to Cointelegraph, Fractal Bitcoin, a sidechain scaling solution for Bitcoin (BTC) using the Bitcoin core code, presents a dual-edged opportunity for miners. This solution, which is merge-mined alongside Bitcoin, allows miners to use the same hardware to mine both Bitcoin and Fractal Bitcoin simultaneously. This could potentially enhance miner profits in the post-halving environment without the need for retooling facilities for AI or high-performance computing. However, the introduction of Fractal Bitcoin also poses a risk to miner revenues. By supporting the BRC-20 token standard and offering a faster, cheaper scaling solution for the Bitcoin base layer, Fractal Bitcoin could reduce network fees generated by the demand for non-fungible tokens on the Bitcoin network, thereby decreasing miner profits. Despite a decline in the initial hype around Bitcoin Runes, ordinals, BRC-20 tokens, and inscriptions, these tokenized assets continue to provide a significant source of revenue for Bitcoin miners. Following the halving event in April 2024, the minting of Bitcoin Runes contributed 1,200 BTC in network fees to miners by the end of that month, initially offsetting the decreased block subsidy. Since then, Bitcoin Runes have generated approximately $162.4 million in fees, excluding other tokenized assets on the Bitcoin network. The potential success of Fractal Bitcoin and other Bitcoin layer-2 solutions could mirror the revenue collapse experienced by Ethereum's layer-1 network. Since the launch of the Dencun upgrade in March 2024, which significantly reduced fees for Ethereum’s layer-2 transactions, Ethereum network fees have steadily declined. This reduction led to a surge in Ethereum layer-2 networks and increased competition to offer the fastest and cheapest scaling solutions. Consequently, fees on the Ethereum base layer have plummeted by 99% since the Dencun upgrade went live earlier this year.","Fractal Bitcoin is a sidechain scaling solution for Bitcoin (BTC) using the Bitcoin core code.

Source: CryptoQuantBitcoin Network Activity Hits Three-Year LowsAt its peak in mid-March, Bitcoin’s daily active addresses numbered around 1.2 million, corresponding with its recent price rally. However, as of late August, this figure has dropped to 744,000, the lowest level since 2021. The current number of active addresses now sits at approximately 838,000, indicating significantly reduced transaction activity on the network.CryptoQuant contributor Gaah highlights that this dip suggests a decline in overall interest in Bitcoin as network users and investors pull back.Transaction Drop and Market SentimentGaah pointed out, ""A decline in active addresses indicates less overall activity on the Bitcoin network, i.e. fewer transactions are taking place, which may reflect less interest in using the network at this point in the market.""This decline aligns with Bitcoin’s lack of decisive price movement, leaving it stuck in what some analysts describe as an “unstable” range. The popular Puell Multiple indicator—used to assess miner profitability—shows similar indecision, reinforcing the sense of stagnation in the market.A Brewing Opportunity?While the drop in activity signals disinterest, CryptoQuant’s analysis also hints at a potential buying opportunity. Lower network activity and stagnant prices often present attractive entry points for long-term investors who anticipate a future rally.Gaah commented, ""For some investors, a drop in active addresses and price can be seen as an opportunity to buy Bitcoin in anticipation of a future rally."" However, if this disinterest grows, new price supports may need to be established, providing further buying opportunities.“Chopsolidation” and the Potential for a BreakoutThe Bitcoin price has been characterized by what some analysts, like the pseudonymous Checkmate, call “chopsolidation”—a blend of consolidation and erratic price swings.

2024-09-04,"According to CoinDesk, as the cryptocurrency market reaches new heights, led by assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana, investors are increasingly focused on optimizing their portfolios. While the growth potential of these major cryptocurrencies is evident, the challenge in this maturing market is the hunt for yield, especially for Bitcoin holders and those seeking effective collateral options.Bitcoin’s primary appeal has always been its potential for significant capital appreciation. However, unlike Ethereum and Solana, which offer staking rewards, Bitcoin lacks a straightforward method for generating yield. Traditionally, investors have resorted to lending their Bitcoin to earn interest. This approach carried significant risks, particularly due to rehypothecation, where assets were used as collateral for further lending. This practice led to a credit bubble that burst in 2022, resulting in widespread insolvencies and a loss of trust in many facets of the market.The fallout from the 2022 crisis has pushed the industry to innovate. One of the most promising developments has been the rise of tokenized money market funds. These funds offer a way to generate yield with the speed and efficiency of crypto combined with the safety of government-backed Treasury bills. Unlike stablecoins, which are also backed by similar assets but often fail to provide yield, tokenized money market funds offer an efficient option for collateral and margining purposes, aligning with the needs of investors seeking both yield and safety.In addition to these funds, some of the top digital asset managers have devised strategies to generate yield on long Bitcoin positions without the need for lending. By entering into carefully selected derivatives structures, investors can earn options-yield while retaining segregated custody of their assets and without sacrificing upside. This approach addresses the dual challenge of income generation and asset security, offering a viable alternative for long-term holders who have traditionally relied on buy-and-hold strategies.The hunt for yield in crypto is evolving. As the market matures, integrating yield-generating mechanisms like tokenized money market funds and secure options vaults will likely become essential for professional portfolios. These innovations represent a new frontier in crypto investment, where the focus is not just on capital appreciation but also on generating steady, reliable income. For investors, this marks a significant shift—one that could redefine the role of crypto in diversified portfolios.","As the cryptocurrency market matures, investors are looking for yield-generating methods to improve their portfolios.

2024-09-04,"According to Cointelegraph, Bitcoin mining companies are exploring diversification into data centers to enhance revenue. However, Phil Harvey, CEO of blockchain data center consulting firm Sabre56, argues that this shift to high-performance computing is impractical due to significant cost differences and logistical challenges. Harvey highlighted that operating an AI or high-performance data center is far more expensive than running a crypto mining facility. He noted that a typical commercial mining operation costs between $300,000 and $350,000 per megawatt, whereas AI data centers require between $3 million and $5 million per megawatt—a 10-15x increase. Additionally, a mining operation with a gigawatt of available power can only convert approximately 200 megawatts for high-performance computing needs. The CEO emphasized that only about 20% of a miner's portfolio could potentially support the necessary attributes like power, data, and land for AI. He also pointed out the significant physical space requirements, with crypto mining needing 1,000 square feet per megawatt compared to 5,000 square feet per megawatt for AI or HPC data centers. Furthermore, converting crypto mining facilities to AI and high-performance data centers involves substantial upfront costs, with over 90% of existing infrastructure needing replacement. Bitcoin miners are seeking alternative revenue streams due to decreased block subsidies and reduced revenues, which hit an 11-month low in August. The idea of shifting to AI data centers and high-performance computing has been proposed, raising concerns about energy resource allocation between the emerging AI industry and crypto mining. A report by VanEck suggested that Bitcoin mining companies could potentially earn $13.9 billion in annual revenues if they allocate 20% of their output to AI data processing and high-performance computing. However, the practical challenges and significant costs involved in such a transition make it a complex and potentially unfeasible solution for many mining companies.",Bitcoin mining companies are considering shifting to AI data centers and high-performance computing to boost their revenue.

Fundstrat vice president of digital asset strategy Sean Farrell joins Morning Brief to discuss what this month may have in store for crypto investors. ""If you look at the historical averages, September really is the only month in which bitcoin has an average negative return. But you know, we like to advise our clients and subscribers that you can't just look at seasonality in and of itself. There are some structural things that are endemic to seasonality, like lack of liquidity that we've seen really take a toll on crypto markets over the past couple of weeks that do weigh on prices,"" Farrell explains. Instead of focusing on seasonality, he encourages investors to watch the Federal Reserve's next moves as it gears up for an interest rate easing cycle. He explains that Friday's jobs report will help paint a better picture of the Fed's next moves as ""a lot of the market right now is skittish about rate cuts."" With the jobs data expected to come in soft but non-recessionary, he adds, ""Our money is still on the soft landing path."" Farrell also notes that the election will also play into the crypto market's performance this September: ""It would be silly not to view the election as a critical factor that will come into play when thinking about crypto prices... Our in-house view is that if Trump were to get elected, that would certainly slap on a premium to crypto asset prices.

Fundstrat vice president of digital asset strategy Sean Farrell joins Morning Brief to discuss how investors can best navigate the rest of 2024. ""I think it's important to step back from a high level and understand acute trading risks versus cyclical downturn risks,"" Farrell argues. He continues, ""If you step back and listen to [Federal Reserve Chair Jerome] Powell at Jackson Hole and think about the Fed's positioning around markets right now and how they've shifted focus away from inflation towards employment, they've kind of taken away the right tail — or should I say, the worst case scenario for crypto — which would be a stagflationary period in which real growth is slowing and the Fed has to step up and be hawkish regardless of that fact because inflation is soaring."" He notes that such a stagflationary period occurred back in 2022, causing liquidity conditions to tighten amid high inflation. However, it appears as if the Federal Reserve is moving away from that scenario as it gears up for its interest rate easing cycle, which will benefit bitcoin down the line: ""We are certainly going to meet any kind of recession with more easing, more liquidity, in which case, bitcoin will be the fastest horse out of there.""

Despite the decline in whale activity over the past six months, long-term accumulation by whale addresses remains relatively high.Meanwhile, data from Intotheblock shows that Bitcoin addresses holding between 1,000 and 10,000 BTC comprise the largest share of the total Bitcoin supply at 24.17%. Addresses holding between 10 and 100 BTC and 100 and 1,000 BTC also account for significant portions of the supply, at 22.08% and 20.32%, respectively.

The Supply per Whale metric, created by Charles Edwards, measures the accumulation and distribution behavior of large Bitcoin holders. It is defined as the total supply owned by addresses holding 100 to 10,000 BTC, divided by the address count. This metric increases when whales accumulate and decreases during distribution events.

The robbery, which took place near Glasgow, involved three men armed with a machete and a Toblerone chocolate bar breaking into a home. This case, initially heard last year, was notable for being the first in Scotland to involve tracing stolen cryptocurrency, according to Detective Inspector Craig Potter from Police Scotland’s Cyber Investigations unit.In a groundbreaking move, prosecutors utilized proceeds of crime legislation to seize and convert the stolen Bitcoin into cash. The court proceedings revealed that the home invasion occurred in Blantyre, southeast of Glasgow, where one of the intruders repeatedly beat a woman with a personalized Toblerone bar and threw her into a bedroom.

This decline extends Bitcoin's seven-day drop to over 10%, reflecting a broader downturn in the crypto market. Market analysis indicates a historically bearish trend for September, with Bitcoin typically seeing a monthly decline of 6% on average. Major cryptocurrencies such as Solana, BNB Chain’s BNB, XRP, and Cardano’s ADA fell as much as 3%, while Dogecoin led the losses among the largest cryptocurrencies with a 5% drop.

Ether ETFs had zero net inflows or outflows despite $173 million in trading volume. Traditional markets in the U.S. remained closed due to the Labor Day holiday. Some traders noted that Bitcoin's loss aligns with the bearish seasonality observed in September. However, they suggested that potential interest-rate cuts by the U.S. Federal Reserve could alter this trend. Innokenty Isers, founder of crypto exchange Paybis, mentioned that September is historically a negative month for Bitcoin, with an average value depletion rate of 6.56%. He added that if the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates in September, it might help Bitcoin overcome its negative trend, as rate cuts generally lead to an increased flow of U.S. dollars in the economy, strengthening Bitcoin's outlook as a store of value. Seasonality refers to the tendency of assets to experience regular and predictable changes throughout the calendar year. While these changes may appear random, they can be attributed to factors such as profit-taking around tax season in April and May, which causes drawdowns, and the generally bullish 'Santa Claus' rally in December, indicating increased demand.

Source: BitboAccording to Grizzly, the Puell Multiple is currently fluctuating between the “Decision Zone” of 0.6 and 0.8. Historical patterns indicate that when the index drops below the 0.6 threshold, it often signals a prime opportunity for dollar-cost averaging (DCA) strategies in Bitcoin. As of the latest data, the Puell Multiple stands at 0.69, a level that suggests the possibility of a bullish reversal.The Puell Multiple serves as a gauge of miner revenue health, with a high index typically indicating low sell pressure and a low index signaling higher sell pressure.

2024-09-01,"According to Cointelegraph, a widely-used Bitcoin indicator that helps traders assess miner selling activity is nearing a level that could signal a promising buying opportunity for Bitcoin. CryptoQuant contributor Grizzly highlighted in an August 31 analyst note that the Puell Multiple index is fluctuating between two critical levels. Historical patterns suggest that if the index drops below 0.6, it could indicate a favorable buying opportunity for investors. On April 20, around the time of the Bitcoin halving, the Puell Multiple Index score was 1.76, according to Bitbo. Grizzly explained that the range between 0.6 and 0.8 on the Puell Multiple Index is known as the “Decision Zone.” Historical data dating back to 2014 shows that when the index drops below the 0.6 threshold, it has often signaled an ideal opportunity for Bitcoin Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) strategies.

At the time of publication, the Puell Multiple is reading a score of 0.69, according to Bitbo data. For context, when Bitcoin hit its all-time high of $73,679 on March 13, the Puell Multiple was at 1.88.

2024-08-31,"According to Cointelegraph, Bitcoin's next move must print a bullish 'higher high' on the price chart to keep its uptrend intact after recently dropping below $58,000, as per crypto analyst Matthew Hyland. Hyland emphasized the importance of Bitcoin bouncing back and making a higher high to confirm the ongoing uptrend since August. He noted that Bitcoin must stay above the $57.7K level and, if it breaks down, it must hold the $56K level to avoid a lower low. However, some traders believe Bitcoin needs to drop further before resuming its uptrend. Markus Thielen, head of Research at 10x Research, suggested waiting for Bitcoin's price to fall into the low $40,000s for an ideal entry into the bull market. At the time of publication, Bitcoin is trading at $59,218, recovering from a dip to $57,925 in the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap data. Bitcoin is down 7.69% over the past seven days. Hyland reiterated that since August, Bitcoin has seen higher lows and higher highs, despite major pullbacks at the beginning of both July and August. He believes Bitcoin will experience some volatility ahead of the United States presidential election on November 4 and expects mostly sideways action in September, historically the worst-performing month for Bitcoin. Cointelegraph noted that Bitcoin's price action in September might not follow previous years' trends, as Bitcoin miner selling pressure has stabilized and the stablecoin supply ratio shows bullish signs. Meanwhile, pseudonymous crypto trader Jelle shared with their 91,000 X followers that a multi-year view of the Bitcoin price chart suggests Bitcoin could still reach the six-figure mark in the near term.

2024-08-31,"According to Cointelegraph, Bitcoin mining firm Rhodium Enterprises, which recently filed for bankruptcy, has received court approval to take a loan in either United States dollars or Bitcoin. The company has been authorized to choose between receiving $30 million or 500 Bitcoin from Galaxy Digital, a blockchain firm led by Mike Novogratz. The dollar loan would carry a 14.5% annual interest rate, while the Bitcoin loan would have a lower interest rate of 9.5%, according to a Bloomberg report. With the lender’s approval, Rhodium could repay the Bitcoin loan in US dollars based on the “reasonable published market spot prices” at the time of repayment, prior to the due date. The approval is unusual for bankruptcy financing in the crypto sector due to Bitcoin’s price volatility, which makes it challenging to predict the total amount of loan payments, regardless of the interest rate. On Aug. 24, Rhodium Enterprises filed for voluntary bankruptcy under Chapter 11 in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas, disclosing liabilities of up to $100 million. The filing included six subsidiaries — Rhodium Encore, Jordan HPC, Rhodium JV, Rhodium 2.0, Rhodium 10MW, and Rhodium 30MW. According to the document, the company’s debts range between $50 million and $100 million, while its total assets are valued between $100 million and $500 million. By filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy voluntarily, the company can reorganize its debts while continuing to operate. This allows it to negotiate a revised repayment plan under new terms. Bitcoin mining firms have been facing significant pressure due to reduced mining rewards following the Bitcoin halving in April. Additionally, concerns have arisen over their mounting debt and previous mismanagement. “Cash-rich miners like Riot Platforms and Cleanspark acquired other miners with turn-key facilities to increase near-term hashrate and increase their power pipeline,” said JPMorgan in a recent report. Capital-constrained miners like IREN and Cipher focused on securing greenfield opportunities, which require less immediate capital, the report added. On Aug. 21, Bitcoin mining firm Bitfarms announced its acquisition of Stronghold Digital Mining for about $125 million, which also takes into account assumed debt of about $50 million.","Rhodium Enterprises has received court approval to take a $30 million or 500 Bitcoin from Galaxy Digital.

2024-08-30,"According to Cointelegraph, a new peer-reviewed scientific paper titled 'An Integrated Landfill Gas-to-Energy and Bitcoin Mining Framework,' published in the Aug. 29 edition of the Journal of Cleaner Production, has demonstrated how Bitcoin (BTC) mining could play a significant role in reducing methane emissions. The research highlights how Bitcoin miners can leverage 'Landfill Gas to Energy' (LFGTE) systems to capture and convert methane gas from landfills into usable energy, thereby sequestering the greenhouse gas and mitigating its harmful effects on the atmosphere. The paper argues that Bitcoin mining offers the proper incentive structure for such capital-intensive, long-term projects, which other private enterprises often lack due to the absence of sustainable revenue generation and cost recovery strategies. The researchers stated, 'Bitcoin’s economic incentives, available globally for miners in any location, may offer an innovative solution for encouraging methane mitigation without the need for government incentives—presenting a scalable and novel solution for rapid deployment.' They also noted that this incentive structure could be applied to other underutilized energy sources, such as orphaned oil and gas wells, wastewater treatment plants, farms, and agricultural processing operations. In 2023, Marathon Digital, formerly known as MARA, partnered with Nodal Power to mine Bitcoin using methane gas in Utah. At the time of the 280-kilowatt initiative's announcement, MARA Chairman and CEO Fred Thiel stated, 'At Marathon, we are constantly seeking innovative ways to diversify our operations, lower our energy costs, and leverage the unique aspects of Bitcoin mining to better the environments in which we operate.' In May 2024, the company furthered this mission by signing a deal with the Kenyan government to develop renewable energy infrastructure within the country. The findings of the recent paper are corroborated by other research. In 2023, a study published by the Institute of Risk Management found that Bitcoin mining operations could reduce global emissions by around 8% by 2030.","Bitcoin mining can reduce methane emissions by 8% by 2030.

2024-08-30,"According to Cointelegraph, long-term Bitcoin (BTC) holders often encounter challenges when trying to use their wealth to secure financing. Adam Reeds, CEO and co-founder of Ledn, a company specializing in Bitcoin lending services, discussed how Bitcoin collateralized loans can enhance the velocity of money and capital. Reeds highlighted that many early Bitcoin adopters are reluctant to sell their BTC to access liquidity and often find it difficult to secure loans from traditional financial institutions, which may not recognize Bitcoin holdings as collateral. This situation keeps the collateral locked up and unproductive in the broader economy. The solution, according to Reeds, is to utilize Bitcoin collateral by borrowing against it. This allows Bitcoin holders to access fiat-denominated liquidity for various purposes, such as financing a business, consumer spending, real estate, or even acquiring more BTC. Bitcoin loans are highly efficient, enabling borrowers to secure financing within days, unlike the weeks or months typically required by traditional institutions. Reeds emphasized the soundness of Bitcoin as collateral, agreeing with Michael Saylor's view that Bitcoin is a thermodynamically sound asset class, free from the physical depreciation that affects many other asset types. He stated that lending against Bitcoin is a lower-risk activity compared to lending against real estate or equities, as Bitcoin lacks GAAP risk. Reeds also noted that Bitcoin is not subject to counterparty risks such as false media reports, fake whistleblower accounts, and bad press, which can negatively impact the price of a business or equity. Reeds also addressed the lack of banking infrastructure and adequate financial services in some parts of the world. He suggested that Bitcoin-collateralized loans could provide financial opportunities for the unbanked and those living in high-inflation environments. Examples include Argentina, with a 276% annual inflation rate, and Nigeria, which has an unbanked population of 38 million residents.","Adam Reeds is the CEO and co-founder of Ledn, a company specializing in Bitcoin lending services.

2024-08-30,"According to Odaily, Shehzan, the founder of Lava, has estimated that around 400 'second-layer' solutions are currently operating on the Bitcoin blockchain. During the Gwart Show on August 25, Shehzan highlighted that the actual value of these roll-ups and alternative blockchains is under scrutiny. There is a significant variance in the estimated number of these projects, with some suggesting there are only 80 to 85, while others believe the number exceeds 1,000. This discrepancy arises because anyone can 'rollup' data and broadcast a small hash to any miner, technically creating a 'Bitcoin second layer.' In reality, many of these are simple clones of Ethereum roll-ups, handling most activities on centralized servers outside the Bitcoin network and periodically broadcasting the state hash to Bitcoin blocks.","Shehzan estimates that around 400'second-layer' solutions are currently operating on the Bitcoin blockchain.

2024-08-29,"According to Cointelegraph, Bitcoin miners are facing significant economic challenges due to high operational costs and reduced block rewards. Andy Fajar Handika, CEO and co-founder of Loka Mining, has proposed a solution to address these issues by introducing forward hashrate contracts. These contracts allow miners to sell their future hashrate in exchange for fiat-denominated loans, providing immediate financial support for their operations and growth. Handika explained that these tokenized contracts, available in 3-month, 6-month, and 1-year terms, enable miners to purchase more mining equipment and mitigate price volatility risks. The risk associated with Bitcoin's price fluctuations is transferred to investors who buy the mining contracts. Additionally, creditors benefit from this arrangement as the hashrate forward contracts can be used as collateral for other loans, similar to asset restaking. This method offers an alternative to traditional fundraising approaches, such as initial public offerings or issuing corporate debt, which are typically accessible only to large mining companies. Smaller mining operations often rely on selling their Bitcoin holdings or using them as collateral for decentralized finance (DeFi) loans, which carry significant risks due to potential sudden downturns in Bitcoin's price. The Bitcoin mining industry has been under considerable economic strain. A recent report from cloud mining firm BitFuFu highlighted that mining expenses have surged by 168% over the past year. This increase in costs, coupled with decreased block subsidies, has placed substantial pressure on mining companies. Many are now diversifying their operations into artificial intelligence and high-performance computing to offset the decline in profits. A JPMorgan report also noted the ongoing consolidation within the industry, with cash-rich companies like CleanSpark and Riot Platforms acquiring competitors that can no longer sustain their operations. This consolidation reflects the broader challenges faced by the Bitcoin mining sector as it adapts to the new economic realities post-halving.","Bitcoin miners are facing significant economic challenges due to high operational costs and reduced block rewards.

On bitcoin's prospects of riding high to $73,000, McMillan states: ""I think it's a coin flip. A lot of it rides on whether or not we get a recession, and if we do, how bad it is.

MicroStrategy's Executive Chairman Michael Saylor has significantly increased his company's Bitcoin holdings through large-scale borrowing, making it one of the largest Bitcoin holders globally. Marathon Digital's move highlights the challenges faced by the mining industry, where mining profits have significantly declined, forcing companies to explore alternative methods to sustain operations.

This approach aims to bolster the company's reserves by holding Bitcoin and making opportunistic purchases during market lows, with the expectation that future Bitcoin price increases will yield higher investment returns.

2024-08-28,"According to 10x Research: Bitcoin's market dynamics have recently taken a sharp turn, with traders experiencing significant liquidations as the cryptocurrency struggles to maintain levels above $60,000. This analysis delves into the factors behind the current volatility, offering insights into what might be driving these sudden market shifts.Accurate Predictions but Reversed GainsOn August 22, our forecast accurately predicted Bitcoin's breakout from a symmetrical triangle, leading to a rally toward the $65,000 mark. This surge was fueled by dovish remarks from Fed Chair Jerome Powell, which initially supported a +10% gain. However, these gains have since fully reversed, raising concerns about potential risks as we approach September.Massive Bitcoin Withdrawals: A Bullish or Bearish Signal?In the past 24 hours, nearly 50,000 Bitcoins have been withdrawn from exchanges. Typically, such large withdrawals indicate a bullish trend, as investors move their assets into cold storage for long-term holding. This reduces immediate selling pressure, suggesting confidence in Bitcoin's future price appreciation. However, the fact that these withdrawals were concentrated on a single exchange raises questions about the underlying reasons.Declining Open Interest and Market MisinterpretationsOpen interest in Bitcoin futures has sharply declined over the past 24 hours, likely due to traders being stopped out near the close of the U.S. session. This decline in open interest coincides with significant liquidations that began around the $62,000 resistance level— a barrier that had held since early August.Many market participants appear to have misinterpreted Powell's speech, overly focusing on the prospect of imminent monetary easing. However, Powell's remarks highlighted weaknesses in the labour market, signalling that while rate cuts may be on the horizon, they do not equate to immediate economic stimulus.What Lies Ahead: Tactical Opportunities or Increased Risk?As we move into a critical week for risk assets, with key economic data releases on the horizon, the market's response will be crucial. Despite supportive factors like corporate share buybacks, even major stock indices like the Nasdaq have struggled to rally.For traders, today's drop presents an intriguing opportunity for those looking to capitalize on a tactical rally. Entering the market at $59,000 with a tight stop at $58,000 could be a cautious yet strategic move. However, the sudden and concentrated Bitcoin withdrawals suggest that there may be more at play than meets the eye.ConclusionBitcoin's current market volatility reflects a complex mix of factors, from macroeconomic signals to significant movements within crypto exchanges. As traders navigate these uncertain waters, understanding the broader context and potential underlying issues will be key to making informed decisions. With September looming, the next few weeks could be pivotal for Bitcoin's market trajectory.","Bitcoin's market dynamics have taken a sharp turn, with traders experiencing significant liquidations as the cryptocurrency struggles to maintain levels above $60,000.

2024-08-28,"According to CoinDesk, Stacks, the Bitcoin layer-2 blockchain, has commenced the Satoshi upgrade, aiming to decouple its block production schedule from Bitcoin's. This upgrade, named after Bitcoin's pseudonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto, seeks to enhance transaction speeds on the Stacks network.

2024-08-28,"According to Cointelegraph, in an era where artificial intelligence is rapidly evolving, the authenticity of online content is increasingly in question. Jeff Garzik, co-founder and CEO of Bloq, discussed with Cointelegraph how the Bitcoin network might offer a solution for data provenance in the 21st century. Garzik highlighted the current issue of AI-generated content overshadowing trusted sources of information. He emphasized that this problem will likely intensify as AI becomes more prevalent. Data provenance, which involves verifying the origin of data, will become crucial in a future dominated by AI agents. Garzik provided an example of an AI agent autonomously managing and trading crypto assets for a human investor, requiring minimal human input for confirmation. To address this issue, Garzik proposed using the Bitcoin network as a data anchoring layer. This process involves authenticating the origin of data by recording it on the blockchain. He argued that Bitcoin's blockchain is the most secure and likely to persist over the next decade, making it an ideal choice for anchoring data. Garzik noted that other blockchain networks often prune ledger data, making them unsuitable for permanent data provenance. Garzik also mentioned the potential problem of network congestion if data were anchored directly to the Bitcoin base layer. He pointed to the recent surge in Bitcoin Runes and Ordinals mints as an example of how network congestion can drive up transaction fees. To mitigate this, Garzik and his team at Bloq have developed Hemi, a Bitcoin layer-2 network. Hemi handles most of the network traffic while leveraging Bitcoin's base layer for final settlement, thus reducing network bloat and transaction fees. Garzik used the analogy of a champagne waterfall to illustrate the importance of layer-2 solutions, where the top glass represents the Bitcoin base layer, and the overflow is managed by layer-2 solutions. Garzik concluded by stating that the interaction between Bitcoin layer-2 solutions and the base layer would benefit users by lowering transaction fees while maintaining high security. This approach aims to preserve the integrity and reliability of the Bitcoin network as a foundation for data provenance in an AI-driven world.","The authenticity of online content is increasingly in question.

Cornell University professor Eswar Prasad speaks on the voter demographic crypto-friendly policies open up for the two candidates, particularly Trump, heading into November.

They haven't laid out a policy position on this yet, but there are indications that there is some outreach from the campaign to the crypto community."" But is the fact key political figures are warming up to cryptocurrencies like bitcoin (BTC-USD) and their respective ETFs, legitimizing these decentralized assets, actually hurting the crypto cause? ""The irony here is that the whole point of Bitcoin was to get away from traditional financial institutions, to get away from reliance on any sort of government trust,"" Prasad says. ""So this was supposed to be a trustless technology, but it seems to be being swept into the arms of traditional finance and into the mainstream...

2024-08-12,"Bitcoin (BTC-USD) is up more than 35% year to date, the crypto asset currently hovering below $60,000, and with big gains comes big tax responsibilities. Gordon Law Partner Andrew Gordon joins Wealth! to break down the best tax strategies for crypto investors and how the industry might change following the 2024 presidential election. ""Although cryptocurrency can be considered very complex from a tax standpoint, at the most basic level it's taxed much the same as stocks or other securities. And so there are long-term and short-term capital gains, and you're taxed every time there's an exchange, a swap, or a sale. But what makes crypto unique is that you're not just taxed when you cash out to cash, but you're also taxed every time you convert from one crypto to another,"" Gordon explains. As the presidential election is under three months away, Gordon notes that politicians are speaking about crypto more than ever before: ""It seems to mark a shift from regulation by enforcement, which we have seen for several years through agencies such as the SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission), but perhaps now a shift to politicians supporting and embracing crypto and implementing regulation and legislation to support to allow innovation to occur and to allow individuals to hold crypto and not become criminals."" Crypto executives met with White House officials via video call last week to express their concerns about how the Biden administration and regulators have treated the industry. While the Republican Party has embraced cryptocurrency more than the Democratic Party, Gordon explains the issue is bipartisan. ""What I hope will happen over time is that it becomes an issue that regardless of which side of the political front you're on, that you understand that the crypto tax side of things needs to change. With over 40% of Americans holding cryptocurrency, it's time that the tax gap be reduced by policies that allow individual investors to report crypto simply, easily, and also allow the IRS, the Treasury, to collect on taxes that are rightfully owed,"" he adds.

Wall Street was rocked on Monday as US equities (^GSPC, ^DJI, ^IXIC) were in a free fall, finding some relief and eventually staging a bounce back on Tuesday. Part of those declines is due in part to issues with the Bank of Japan raising its interest rates. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) is also bouncing back after a large drop in value, currently sitting above $50,000. Yahoo Finance Reporter Jared Blikre breaks down the top takeaways for the trading day on Tuesday, August 6. KeyBanc Capital Markets equity research analyst Jackson Ader joins Asking For A Trend to give insight into the tech sector, how its performing, and what investors need to know. In terms of a chief concern this earnings season for Big Tech CapEx spending, Ader relates back to Microsoft (MSFT) and its recent earnings: ""What Microsoft said was, hey, we're actually a little bit more flexible than maybe you realize only half of our CapEx really goes into those fixed long term, 15, 20 year assets. And the other half is kits and GPUs. Maybe they're going to be GPUs, maybe they're going to be CPUs, maybe they're going to be in-house chips, but the focus on flexibility in artificial intelligence, I think is going to be a really good one, and key for the industry..."" The S&P 500 recovered some of its sell-off losses, closing Tuesday's session 1.03% higher. While the widespread selling activity erased a sizable chunk of the Magnificent Seven's market cap, is this pattern of peak-to-trough declines really unprecedented for the index? Julie Hyman breaks down Goldman Sachs charts illustrating the S&P 500's history of sell-offs and ability to bounce back from similar pullbacks. Oil markets (CL=F, BZ=F) are experiencing a rebound along the broader market and as tensions rise in the Middle East. Sankey Research president and lead analyst Paul Sankey explains, ""This latest issue that we're facing between Israel and Iran is not in itself even a new twist to the plot. And in that regard, if you think back to, say, 2019, when Iranian proxies attacked Saudi Arabia and knocked out 7 million barrels a day of capacity, or when Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, I'm sad to say that the current environment is not very scary for oil supply interruptions. I will say that the markets are quite scary. So the financial markets are really driving oil right now."" Lastly, a slew of companies released their latest quarterly reports after the market close.

Newton points to the XLB healthcare sector ETF (XLB) as one opportunity for investors, as it has steadily grown in 2024 and hit record highs despite an ongoing sell-off since mid-July. He also highlights that equal-weighted industrials and financial ETFs from Invesco — (RSPN) and (RSPF) — both hit new all-time highs last week. He notes that these areas of the market are being ""disguised"" and ""camouflaged"" by the ""Big Tech wreck."" ""Investors have been overexposed, have huge concentration in technology. So a big sell-off like that in an area which is a major focus certainly hurts,"" Newton adds. ""But I would say that honestly, for those that diversify, there are plenty of parts of the market that are still working well. And now with a big breakdown on the dollar, that eventually is going to start to aid emerging markets when we can see a little bit of stabilization to this."" Despite bitcoin (BTC-USD) having its worst week since November 2022, Newton argues that the movement is ""really just a drop in the bucket"" : ""I don't see much more deterioration beyond really the mid to high 40s. And I think we will bottom and we can pull out of this. But it is going to be important for the broader risk asset space to stabilize. It's very unusual and unlikely to see bitcoin simply surge back to new highs if the rest of the world is falling apart.
